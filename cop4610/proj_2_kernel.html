  <h1>Project 2: Elevator Kernel Module</h1>
  <h2>COP4610: Operating Systems</h2>
  <p class="style4">Due: Monday, October 28th, 2024, at 11:59pm</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Gain hands-on experience with system calls: Understand the fundamental
      concepts and implementation details of system calls by working on
      various aspects of kernel programming.
    </li>
    <li>
      Explore kernel programming: Develop a deeper understanding of kernel
      programming by delving into the intricacies of concurrency and
      synchronization mechanisms within the kernel.
    </li>
    <li>
      Enhance knowledge of concurrency and synchronization: Apply the acquired
      knowledge of concurrency and synchronization in the kernel environment
      to effectively manage and control concurrent access to shared resources.
    </li>

      prevent race conditions.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of system
    calls, kernel programming, concurrency, synchronization, and elevator
    scheduling algorithms. It consists of multiple parts that build upon each
    other to deepen your knowledge and skills in these areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Part 1, you start by working with system calls. By adding system calls
    to a C/Rust program and verifying their correctness using the "strace"
    tool, you gain hands-on experience with system call integration and learn
    about the available system calls for your machine. This part lays the
    foundation for understanding how system calls interact with the kernel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part 2 takes you further into kernel programming. You will develop a
    kernel module called "my_timer" that retrieves and stores the current time
    using the "ktime_get_real_ts64()" function. This module creates a proc
    entry and allows you to read the current time and elapsed time since the
    last call. This part helps you understand how kernel modules work, how to
    interact with kernel functions, and how to use proc interfaces for
    communication.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part 3 focuses on a more complex task: implementing a scheduling algorithm
    for a dorm elevator. You create a kernel module representing the elevator,
    supporting operations like starting, stopping, and issuing requests. The
    module also provides a "/proc/elevator" entry to display important
    elevator information. This part challenges you to manage concurrency,
    synchronization, and efficient scheduling within the kernel environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each part of the project builds upon the knowledge and skills gained in
    the previous parts. Part 1 introduces you to system calls and their
    integration, which forms the basis for kernel programming in Part 2. Part
    2 expands your understanding of kernel modules and communication through
    proc interfaces, setting the stage for the more advanced concepts explored
    in Part 3.
  </p>
  <p>
    By completing this project, you acquire practical experience in system
    calls, kernel programming, concurrency, synchronization, and scheduling
    algorithms. These are essential skills for developing efficient and robust
    software systems, particularly in operating systems and low-level
    programming domains. Understanding system calls and kernel programming
    enables you to interact with and extend the functionality of the operating
    system, while concurrency, synchronization, and scheduling concepts are
    crucial for efficient resource management and multitasking in complex
    systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Division of Labor</h2>
  <p>Submit your division of labor document on Canvas by 11:59 PM, 10/07/24.</p>

  <h2>Example Code</h2>
  <p>You can find the example code in Module.</p>

  <h2>Part 1: System-Call Tracing</h2>
  <p>Please follow the instructions below to complete Part 1 of the task:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create an empty C program named "empty.c".</li>
    <li>Make a copy of the "empty.c" program and name it "part1.c".</li>
    <li>
      Add exactly four system calls to the "part1.c" program. You can find the
      available system calls for your machine in "/usr/include/unistd.h".
    </li>
    <li>
      To verify that you have added the correct number of system calls,
      execute the following commands in the terminal: <br />
      <span class="style3">$ gcc -o empty empty.c <br />
        $ strace -o empty.trace ./empty <br />
        $ gcc -o part1 part1.c <br />
        $ strace -o part1.trace ./part1
      </span>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    To minimize the length of the output from strace, try to minimize the use
    of other function calls (e.g., stdlib.h) in your program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: Running strace on an empty C program will generate a number of
    system calls. Therefore, when using strace on your Part 1 code, it should
    produce four more system calls than the empty program.
  </p>
  <p>Please submit the following files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>part1/empty.c</li>
    <li>part1/empty.trace</li>
    <li>part1/part1.c</li>
    <li>part1/part1.trace</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Part 2: Timer Kernel Module</h2>
  <p>
    In Unix-like operating systems, the time is often represented as the
    number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1st, 1970). The task
    requires creating a kernel module named "my_timer" that utilizes the
    function ktime_get_real_ts64() to retrieve the time value, which includes
    seconds and nanoseconds since the Epoch.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Develop a kernel module called <span class="style3">my_timer</span> that calls the
      ktime_get_real_ts64() function to obtain the current time. This module
      should store the time value.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the <span class="style3">my_timer</span> module is loaded using insmod, it should create a
      proc entry named "/proc/timer".
    </li>
    <li>
      When the <span class="style3">my_timer</span> module is unloaded using rmmod, the /proc/timer
      entry should be removed.
    </li>
    <li>
      On each read operation of "/proc/timer", utilize the proc interface to
      print both the current time and the elapsed time since the last call (if
      valid).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>To insert a kernel module:</p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ sudo insmod my_timer.ko
  </blockquote>
  <p>To remove a kernel module:</p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ sudo rmmod my_timer.ko
  </blockquote>
  <p>To check for your kernel module:</p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ lsmod | grep my_timer
  </blockquote>

  <p>Example Usage:</p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ cat /proc/timer <br />
    current time: 1518647111.760933999 <br />
    <br />
    $ sleep 1<br />
    <br />
    $ cat /proc/timer<br />
    current time: 1518647112.768429998<br />
    elapsed time: 1.007495999<br />
    <br />
    $ sleep 3<br />
    <br />
    $ cat /proc/timer<br />
    current time: 1518647115.774925999<br />
    elapsed time: 3.006496001<br />
    <br />
    $ sleep 5<br />
    <br />
    $ cat /proc/timer<br />
    current time: 1518647120.780421999<br />
    elapsed time: 5.005496000
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Part 3: Elevator Module</h2>
  <p>Your task is to implement a scheduling algorithm for a dorm elevator. You will create a kernel module <span
      class="style3">elevator</span> to implement this.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The dorm elevator can hold a maximum of 5 passengers and cannot exceed a maximum
      weight of 750lbs</li>
    <li>Each student is randomly chosen as a freshmen, sophomore, junior, or senior, with equal
      likelihood.</li>
    <li>Students select their starting floor and destination floor.</li>
    <li>Students board the elevator in first-in, first-out (FIFO) order.</li>
    <li>Each type of passenger (freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior) has an assigned weight:
      <ul>
        <li>100lbs for freshmen</li>
        <li>150lbs for sophomores</li>
        <li>200lbs for juniors</li>
        <li>250lbs for seniors</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Students on floors wait indefinitely to be serviced.</li>
    <li>Once a student boards the elevator, they can only disembark.</li>
    <li>The elevator must wait for 2.0 seconds when moving between floors and 1.0 seconds
      when loading/unloading passengers.
    </li>
    <li>The building has floor 1 as the minimum (lobby) and floor 6 as the maximum.</li>
    <li>Students can arrive at any time, and each floor must handle an arbitrary number of them.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 1: Add System Calls</h3>
  <p>
    Download the latest stable linux-kernel-6.10.x and follow the provided slides in compiling
    your kernel. You can download from the following link:
  </p>
  <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Download Kernel</a>
  <p>You should move the kernel to your <span class="style3">/usr/src/</span> directory and create a soft link to it as
    so:</p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/src/[kernel_version] ~/[kernel_version]<br />
    $ cd ~/[kernel_version]<br />
  </blockquote>
  <p>This will make it easier to modify from elsewhere instead of having to edit it in a restricted area.</p>
  <p>
    Modify the kernel by adding three system calls to control the elevator and
    create passengers. Assign the following numbers to the system calls:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>548 for start_elevator()</li>
    <li>549 for issue_request()</li>
    <li>550 for stop_elevator()</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The respective function prototypes are as followed:</p>
  <p class="style3">int start_elevator(void)</p>
  <p>
    The start_elevator() system call activates the elevator for service.
    From this point forward, the elevator exists and will begin to service requests.
    It returns 1 if the elevator is already active, 0 for a successful start, and
    -ERRORNUM if initialization fails or -ENOMEM if it couldn't allocate
    memory. The elevator is initialized with the following values:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    State: IDLE<br />
    Current floor: 1<br />
    Number of passengers: 0
  </blockquote>
  <p class="style3">
    int issue_request(int start_floor, int destination_floor, int type)
  </p>
  <p>
    The issue_request() system call creates a request for a passenger,
    specifying the start floor, destination floor, and type of passenger (0
    for freshmen, 1 for sophomore, 2 for junior, 3 for senior). It returns 1 if the request is invalid
    (e.g., out of range or invalid type) and 0 otherwise.
  </p>
  <p class="style3">int stop_elevator(void)</p>
  <p>
    The stop_elevator() system call deactivates the elevator. It stops
    processing new requests (passengers waiting on floors), but it must
    offload all current passengers before complete deactivation. Only when the
    elevator is empty can it be deactivated (state = OFFLINE). The system call
    returns 1 if the elevator is already in the process of deactivating and 0
    otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>You will need to make these files to add the system calls:
  <ul>
    <li>[kernel_version]/syscalls/syscalls.c</li>
    <li>[kernel_version]/syscalls/Makefile</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>You will need to modify the following files to add te system calls:
  <ul>
    <li>[kernel_version]/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl</li>
    <li>[kernel_version]/include/linux/syscalls.h</li>
    <li>[kernel_version]/Makefile</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Compile and Install the Kernel</h3>
  <p>You will need to disable certain certificates when adding system calls, follow the slides.</p>
  <p>
    Compile the kernel with the new system calls.
    The kernel should be compiled with
    the following options:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ make menuconfig<br />
    $ make -j$(nproc)<br />
    $ sudo make modules_install<br />
    $ sudo make install<br />
    $ sudo reboot
  </blockquote>
  <p>Check that you installed your kernel by typing this into the terminal:</p>
  <blockquote><span class="style3">$ uname -r</span></blockquote>
  <p><b>Note: Making kernel is a long process! Make sure to do this part early!</b></p>

  <h3>Step 3: Test System Calls</h3>
  <p>You should test if you successfully added the system called to your installed kernel with the provided tests in
    the example code in the directory <span class="style3">p2-example-code/system-calls-test/</span></p>
  <p>Read <span class="style3">README.md</span> and run the following commands: </p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    $ make <br />
    $ sudo insmod syscheck.ko<br />
    $ make run<br />
  </blockquote>
  <p>You should get a message that tells you if you have the system calls installed or not.</p>
  <p>Then, remove the module, <span class="style3">rmmod syscheck.ko</span>,  since it is used only for testing system calls.</p>

  <h3>Step 4: Implement Elevator</h3>
  <p>
    Implement the elevator kernel module. The module should be named
    "elevator" and should be loaded using insmod. The module should be
    unloaded using rmmod.
  </p>
  <p>Recall that these are the details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use linked lists to handle the number of passengers per floor/elevator.</li>
    <li>Use a kthread to control the elevator movement.</li>
    <li>Use a mutex to control shared data access between floor and elevators.</li>
    <li>Use kmalloc to allocate dynamic memory for passengers.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Step 5: Write to Proc File</h3>
  <p>
    The module must provide a proc entry named /proc/elevator. The following
    information should be printed (labeled appropriately):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The elevator's movement state:
      <ul>
        <li>
          OFFLINE: when the module is installed but the elevator isn't running
          (initial state)
        </li>
        <li>
          IDLE: elevator is stopped on a floor because there are no more
          passengers to service
        </li>
        <li>
          LOADING: elevator is stopped on a floor to load and unload
          passengers
        </li>
        <li>UP: elevator is moving from a lower floor to a higher floor</li>
        <li>DOWN: elevator is moving from a higher floor to a lower floor</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The current floor the elevator is on</li>
    <li>The elevator's current load (weight)</li>
    <li>A list of passengers in the elevator</li>
    <li>The total number of passengers waiting</li>
    <li>The total number of passengers serviced</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For each floor of the building, the following should be printed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An indicator of whether or not the elevator is on the floor.</li>
    <li>The count of waiting passengers.</li>
    <li>
      For each waiting passenger, 2 characters indicating the passenger type and destination
      floor.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example Proc File:</p>
  <blockquote class="style3">
    Elevator state: LOADING<br />
    Current floor: 4<br />
    Current load: 650 lbs<br />
    Elevator status: O5 F2 S4 S1<br /> <br />

    [ ] Floor 6: 1 S3<br />
    [ ] Floor 5: 0<br />
    [*] Floor 4: 2 F1 J2<br />
    [ ] Floor 3: 2 J4 J5 <br />
    [ ] Floor 2: 0<br />
    [ ] Floor 1: 0 <br /> <br />
    Number of passengers: 4<br />
    Number of passengers waiting: 5<br />
    Number of passengers serviced: 61<br /> <br />
  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="style3">F</span> is for freshmen, <span class="style3">O</span> is for sophomore, <span
      class="style3">J</span> is for junior, <span class="style3">S</span> is for seniors.</p>

  <h3>Step 6: Test Elevator</h3>
  <p>
    Interact with two provided user-space applications that enable
    communication with the kernel module:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      producer.c: creates passengers and issues requests to the elevator
      <ul>
        <li><span class="style3">$ ./producer [number_of_passengers]</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      consumer.c: calls the start_elevator() or the stop_elevator() system
      call.
      <ul>
        <li>If the flag is --start, the program starts the elevator.</li>
        <li>If the flag is --stop, the program stops the elevator.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can use the following command to see your elevator in action: </p>
  <blockquote class="style3">$ watch -n [snds] cat [proc_file] </blockquote>
  <p>You can find producer.c and consumer.c programs in <span class="style3">p2-example-code/part3-test-case/syscall-tests</span>.</p>

  <h2>Part 4: Demo</h2>
  <p>
    You will be required to give a 15-minute demo of your elevator kernel module to
    demonstrate your understanding of the project.
    A week before the project is due, registration for the demonstration will open. The presentations will take place
    between 10/28/24 and 11/11/24.
    You will present your project, and then demonstrate the functionality of your elevator.
    Your presentation will involve a brief overview of your elevator, a discussion regarding your implementation, and
    then a demonstration of your elevator.
    You will be required to demonstrate:
  <ul>
    <li>Project source code</li>
    <li>Kernel system calls</li>
    <li>Successful compilation of your elevator</li>
    <li>Successful installation of your elevator</li>
    <li>Successful execution of system calls</li>
    <li>Execution of arbitrary number of test cases on your elevator for 3 minutes</li>
    <li>Successful removal of your elevator</li>
  </ul>
  Any demonstration failing to compile/install a portion of the project successfully during the
  demo will receive a 0 for that portion of the project. Be absolutely sure that you are able to
  install and remove all kernel modules before attempting to demonstrate. The grader may also
  choose to question you on project components. You should be able to demonstrate an
  understanding of the project implementation. Any group member who does not attend this demonstration
  or has little participation will be deducted points.
  </p>
  <b>It should be noted that all source files will be pulled from your GitHub repository.</b>

  <h2>Extra Credit</h2>
  <p>The number of passengers that your elevator is able to transport in a span of 3 minutes (without cheating) will
    receive bonus points. Only groups that have submitted the project before the deadline are elligible for competition.
    The point distribution amongst ranks is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1st place: 5 points</li>
    <li>2nd and 3rd places: 3 points</li>
    <li>4th and 5th places: 1 point</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If there is a tie at any rank, all groups involved in the tie will receive the points associated with that
    position, and the next position(s) will be skipped to avoid double-counting. Example: If two participants are tied
    for 2nd place, they both receive 3 points, but the next group ranks 4th (as the 3rd place is skipped).</p>
  <p>Additionally, a leaderboard will be posted of the top 5 finishers and the number of passengers that they were able
    to transport in three minutes.</p>
  <p>If you score onto the leaderboard, your score will be posted, but your group number remain anonymous.</p>

  <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <p>You can assume that the proc file will only be 10000 characters long.</p>
  <p>You can assume that students will not leave from the same floor they entered from.</p>
  <p>The demo will run off your chosen machine with your chosen kernel module.</p>
  <p>All code ran during the demo will be pulled off your GitHub Classroom repository.</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Restrictions</h2>
  <p>You are only allowed to use C or Rust.</p>
  <p>
    The list of passengers waiting at each floor and the list of passengers on the elevator
    must be stored in a linked list, using your own implementaton or <span class="">linux/list.h</span>.
  </p>
  <p>The passengers must be allocated dynamically using <span class="">kmalloc</span>.</p>
  <p>The elevator activity must be controlled within a <span class="">kthread</span>.</p>
  <p>The elevator must use locking around shared data, using <span class="">mutex</span>.</p>
  <p>The elevator is not circular. For example, you cannot go from floor 6 to floor 1
    or from floor 1 to floor 6 in one move.
  </p>
  <p>The elevator may not cheat, you will lose points and be disqualified from extra credit.</p>

  <h2><b>Rubric</b></h2>
  <p>A program with compilation errors will get 0 points (you must demonstrate your project in front of us).</p>
  <p>Please refer to the standard project syllabus.</a></p>

  <h2>Deliverables</h2>
  <p>You should have the following files/directories in your Git repository:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>part 1/
      <ul>
        <li>empty.c (or empty.rs)</li>
        <li>empty.trace</li>
        <li>part1.c (or part1.rs)</li>
        <li>part1.trace</li>
        <li>Makefile</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>part 2/</li>
    <ul>
      <li>src/</li>
      <li>Makefile</li>
    </ul>
    <li>part 3/
      <ul>
        <li>src/</li>
        <li>Makefile</li>
        <li>syscalls.c</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>README.md</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For this project, you only need to organize your source code and header files into the src/ folder.</p>
  <p>If you are using Rust, the standard Rust project structure (in rubric) will suffice.</p>
  <p>Do not include your final executable(s) in your repository, doing so will result in a deduction!</p>
  <p>For part 2 and part 3, your makefile should produce a kernel module, <span class="style3">my_timer.ko</span> and
    <span class="style3">elevator.ko</span> respectively.</p>

  <h2>Submissions</h2>
