	<h1>Project 3: FAT32 File System</h1>
	<h2>COP4610: Operating Systems</h2>
	<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Due: Monday, December 2nd, 2024, at 11:59pm</p>
	<hr>


	<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Design and implement a user-space shell-like utility capable of interpreting a FAT32 file system image.</li>
		<li>Ensure the program understands basic commands to manipulate the given file system image without corrupting it.</li>
		<li>Develop a robust program that can handle various errors and provide descriptive error messages when encountering issues.</li>
		<li>Create a modular coding design by implementing each file system command in one or more separate functions for better code organization and readability.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p>
		The aim of this project is to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of basic file-system design and implementation by working with the FAT32 file system. Throughout this project, you will delve into the intricacies of the FAT32 file system, including its cluster-based storage, FAT tables, sectors, and directory structure.
	</p>
	<p>
		Your primary task will be to design and implement a user-space, shell-like utility capable of interpreting FAT32 file system images. This utility should allow users to manipulate the given file system image using basic commands without compromising its integrity. It is crucial to ensure that the file system image remains uncorrupted throughout the execution of the program.
	</p>
	<p>
		To achieve this, your program must adhere to several objectives. Firstly, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental commands required to manipulate the file system image. Secondly, it must exhibit robustness by handling various errors that may occur during its execution. Whenever an error arises, the program should provide descriptive error messages to assist users in troubleshooting. Furthermore, the program should continue running smoothly, leaving the file system's state unchanged, even in the presence of erroneous commands or data.
	</p>
	<p>
		To promote good modular coding design, it is essential to implement each file system command using separate functions. This approach will enhance the program's modularity, readability, and maintainability. For example, the "write" command might require multiple shared lookup functions, an update directory entry function, and an update cluster function. By organizing the code into distinct functions, you will achieve a more structured and efficient implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Throughout the project, you can validate the integrity of the image file by utilizing tools such as Hexedit and mounting it with the loop back option. These techniques will help ensure the accuracy and reliability of your program.
	</p>
	<p>
		By undertaking this project, you will gain practical experience in working with file systems and develop a solid foundation in understanding the intricacies of the FAT32 file system.
	</p>

	<h2>Part 1: Mounting the Image File </h2>

	<p>The user will need to mount the image file through command line arguments: </p>
	<blockquote class="style3">./filesys [FAT32 ISO]</blockquote>
	<p>
		You should read the image file and implement the correct structure to store the format of FAT32 and how to navigate it.
		You should close out the program and return an error message if the file does not exist.
		The user will then be greeted with a standard shell (like project 1) that will accept user input. Your terminal should look like this:
	</p>
	<blockquote class="style3">[NAME_OF_IMAGE]/[PATH_IN_IMAGE]/&gt;</blockquote>
	<p>The following commands will need to be implemented: </p>
	<ul class="style1">
		<li><h3>info</h3>
      <p>Parses the boot sector. Prints the field name and corresponding value for each entry, one per line.</p>
      <p>The fields you need to print out are:</p>
      <ul class="style2">
        <li>position of root cluster (in cluster #)</li>
        <li>bytes per sector</li>
        <li>sectors per cluster</li>
        <li>total # of clusters in data region</li>
        <li># of entries in one FAT</li>
        <li>size of image (in bytes)</li>
      </ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul class="style1">
		<li><h3>exit</h3>
      <p>Safely closes the program and frees up any allocated resources.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Part 2: Navigation</h2>

	<p>The following commands will need to be implemented: </p>
	<ul class="style1">
		<li><h3>cd [DIRNAME]</h3>
			<p>Changes the <i>current working directory</i> to <u>DIRNAME</u></p>
		  	<ul class="style2">
          <li>Your code will need to maintain the current working directory state</li>
          <li>Print an error if <u>DIRNAME</u> does not exist or is not a directory.</li>
		  	</ul>
		</li>
		<li><h3>ls</h3>
			<p>Print the name filed for the directories within the <i>current working directory</i> including the “.” and
				“..” directories.</p>
      <ul class="style2">
        <li>For simplicity, you may print each of the directory entries on separate lines</li>
      </ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Part 3: Create</h2>

	<p>The following commands will need to be implemented: </p>

      </ul>
		</li>
		<li><h3>creat [FILENAME]</h3>
			<p>Creates a file in the <i>current working directory</i> with a size of 0 bytes and with a name of <u>FILENAME</u>.</p>
		  	<ul class="style2">
				  <li>Print an error if a directory/file called <u>FILENAME</u> already exists.</li>
		  	</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul class="style1">
		<li><h3>open [FILENAME] [FLAGS]</h3>
      <p>Opens a file named <u>FILENAME</u> in the current working directory.
        A file can only be read from or written to if it is opened first. You will need to
        maintain some data structure of opened files and add <u>FILENAME</u> to it when <span class="style3">open</span> is
        called.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><u>FLAGS</u> is a flag and is only valid if it is one of the following:</p>
        <ul class="style2">
          <li>-r - read-only.</li>
          <li>-w - write-only.</li>
          <li>-rw - read and write.</li>
          <li>-wr - write and read.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initialize the offset of the file at 0. Can be stored in the open file data structure along with
          other info.</p>
          <p>Print an error if the file is already opened, if the file does not exist, or an invalid mode is
          used.</p>
      </blockquote>
		</li>
		<li><h3>close [FILENAME]</h3>
			<p>Closes a file <u>FILENAME</u> in current working directory.</p>

      </ul>
		</li>
		<li><h3>lsof</h3>
			<p>Lists all opened files.</p>
      <ul class="style2">
        <li>Needs to list the index, file name, mode, offset, and path for every opened file.</li>
        <li>If no files are opened, notify the user.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
		<li><h3>lseek [FILENAME] [OFFSET]</h3>
			<p>Set the offset (in bytes) of file <u>FILENAME</u> for further reading or writing.</p>
      <ul class="style2">
        <li>Store the value of <u>OFFSET</u> (in memory) and relate it to the file <u>FILENAME</u>.</li>
        <li>Print an error if file is not opened or does not exist.</li>
        <li>Print an error if <u>OFFSET</u> is larger than the size of the file.</li>
      </ul>
		</li>
		<li><h3>read [FILENAME] [SIZE]</h3>
			<p>Read the data from a file in the current working directory with the name <u>FILENAME</u>.</p>
      <ul class="style2">
      <li>Start reading from the file’s stored offset and stop after reading <u>SIZE</u> bytes.</li>
        <li>If the offset + <u>SIZE</u> is larger than the size of the file, just read until end of file.</li>
        <li>Update the offset of the file to offset + <u>SIZE</u> (or to the size of the file if you reached
        the end of the file).</li>
        <li>Print an error if <u>FILENAME</u> does not exist, if <u>FILENAME</u> is a directory, or if the file is not
        opened for reading.</li>
      </ul>

		The -r option adds the ability to rm to delete a directory and its content recursively.</li>
	  <li><strong>dump [2]</strong><br>
		Hex dump of a directory or file.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>*Extra credit activities must be documented in the README to receive credit*</p>

  	<h2>Test Samples</h2>


	<h2>Helpful Resources</h2>



	<h2>Restrictions &amp; Assumptions</h2>
	<p>Must be implemented in the C or Rust Programming Language (No C++).</p>
	<p>You are only allowed to use the standard C library and standard Rust library to implement Project 3.</p>
	<p>You can assume that at most 10 files will be opened. </p>
	<p>You can assume that FILENAME will be less than 11 characters (7 for name, 3 for extension).</p>
	<p>You do not need to worry about “/” expansions into deeper directories.</p>
	<p>Your makefile must produce an executable named “filesys”.</p>
	<p>File and directory names will not contain spaces or file extensions (ie .txt).</p>
	<p>File and directory names will be names (not paths) within the current working directory.</p>
	<p>You do not need to support long directory names, but these entries may exist in the image; you can safely skip over these entries.</p>
	<p>[STRING] will always be contained within “” quotation marks.</p>
	<p>Unless specified in command description, if the arguments are of incorrect size, print out an error.</p>
	<p>Expect to receive the path of the image file in the main program’s first argument (argv[1]).</p>

	<h2><b>Rubric</b></h2>
	<p>A program with compilation errors will get 0 points (we must be
	able to compile and run your program on <b>linprog</b>)!</p>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
  <p>You should have the following files/directories in your Git repository:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>src</li>
    <li>include</li>
    <li>Makefile</li>
    <li>README.md</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are using Rust, the standard Rust project structure (in rubric) will suffice (you do not need to create a makefile; the cargo build system will suffice).</p>
  <p>Do not include your final executable(s) in your repository, doing so will result in a deduction!</p>
  <p>Your makefile produice one executable, named <span class="style3">filesys</span>. This executable should be placed in the bin/ directory.</p>

	<h2>Submissions</h2>
	<p>Program submissions will be done through GitHub Classroom. Ensure that you have the deliverables in your Git repository by/after the due date. The latest commit will be used, so please account for late deductions (you can rollback to earlier work if you do not want to take any late deductions).</p>
  <p>Additionally, make sure your project will compile in the linprog environment.</p>
<p></p>
