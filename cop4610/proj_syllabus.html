    <h2>Email Policy</h2>
    <p>
      TAs will have a 1 business day email window policy where they will be
      responding to any email sent within 1 business day (M - F by 5PM), barring
      any unforeseen circumstances. Please contact us through email using the
      provided TA email. Messages sent through canvas may not be seen by us
      until the end of the week. Messages left as comments on grades will not be
      seen as we do not receive notifications on those.
    </p>
      <p>Additionally, we will not respond to any technical e-mails. So please do not send in code for us to go over, you should use office hours for that. You may ask general questions regarding the project or any clarifications regarding the projects.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      Students will complete the class projects in teams of 3. This semester we will be requiring everyone to
      work with in a group. We understand that it may not be possible to fill a group with three people, but
      we will try to fill each group if we see students alone or that request help looking for a group. Each
      project submission should consist of a README, a Makefile, and the project source code (binaries and
      executables should be removed), made available on GitHub. We will use GitHub classroom to facilitate
      submissions.
    </p>
    <h2>Project Group Policies</h2>
    <p>
      All student groups for projects must be selected on Canvas using the
      provided group sets by the second recitation over the project. Any student without a group selected by the
      deadline will be randomly assigned a group.
      Additionally partially filled groups will have students randomly added to
			them as needed. <b>If one or more group members are not participating in the
				project they must be reported by group members to the recitation
				instructor by the third recitation covering the project. Any complaints
				past this point will only be considered towards grade penalties for
				members not participating fully.</b>
    </p>
		<p>Students that are reported by their group members before the third recitation for failing to meaningfully contribute to their group project and approved by the TA will be removed from the group and be required to submit their <b>own</b> project.</p>
		<h3>Grade Redistribution</h3> 
		<p>In the case of a complaint filed against a group member after the third recitation and is approved by the TA, the maximum penalty is the deduction of up to 30% of the student's project's grade. Additionally, a redistribution of up to 10% to the other members of the group.</p>
    <h2>Project Grading Policy</h2>
    <p>
      The project will be graded out of 100 points. The distribution of points
      will follow: 70 points for implementation and 30 points for documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a project that cannot compile on linprog will not receive more
      than 30 points.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the project solution does not compile as
      specified in the README, 70 points will be deducted from the total project
      grade. It is the student's responsibility to make sure that the solution
      was correctly tested on submission. Please test your instructions in the README
      file as if you are the grader prior to submitting them. For projects 1 and
      3, grading will be completed on linprog. It is recommended that you
      develop these projects on linprog as it is your responsibility to ensure
      your program compiles and runs correctly on linprog.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additionally, you may have points (based on severity of the issue) deducted from your overall scores due to the following:
    </p><ul>
	<li>segfaults</li>
	<li>memory leaks</li>
	<li>...any other issues similar to the above</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>For project 1 and 3, we will follow this project structure for your respective language. You should organize your repository as follows. Note that root describes the root of the GitHub Repository.</p>
		<h3>C Project Structure</h3>
		<pre>root/
├── bin/           -- executables
├── include/       -- header files
├── obj/           -- object files
├── src/           -- source files
├── Makefile
└── README.md
		</pre>
		<p>If you are programming in C, you must include a makefile to compile your project.
		</p><h3>Rust</h3>
		<pre>root/
├── target/
├── src/
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
		</pre>
		<p>If you are using Rust, it is recommended that you use a makefile, although
			you do not need to, but a sufficient description of how to run your project through cargo is necessary (you should edit the Cargo.toml to produce your executables).
		</p>

		<h2>README</h2>
    <p>
      Your README file will need to contain the following formatted text file.
      </p><ul>
        <li>The project team members' names and division of labor</li>
        <li>List who worked on each part of the project</li>
        <li>A list of files in your repository and a brief description of each file</li>
        <li>How to compile your executables using your Makefile/Cargo</li>
        <li>Known bugs and unfinished portions of the project</li>
        <li>Special considerations or anything I should know when grading your solution</li>
        <li>Any completed extra credit must be documented in the README to receive credit</li>
      </ul>
      You can consult this template for your README file:
			<p><a href="https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~cop4610/README.md">README.md</a></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Bugs</h2>
    <p>
      Your README will contain a list of all known bugs in your program. For
      each bug, include a brief description of when it is occurring (compile,
      link, or runtime), when the bug first showed up, the symptoms the bug is
      giving off, and how you attempted to fix it. Undocumented bugs will incur
      a greater penalty. Demonstrating that you understand why a program has a
      bug, even if you are unsure of how to fix it, shows that you are thorough.
      An undocumented bug shows that you do not understand the program, or that
      you tried to hide a flaw. Undocumented bugs only slow down future
      development.
    </p>
		<h2>Extra Credit Opportunity</h2>
		<p>
			Students who choose to diversify their programming language usage across the three projects will be eligible for a bonus of approximately 1-2% added to their final overall grade. Specifically, utilizing both C and Rust for separate projects.
		</p>
		<h3>Guidelines</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>You must complete all three projects to be eligible for the bonus credit.</li>
			<li>For each project, you have the choice to implement it using either C or Rust.</li>
			<li>Bonus credit will only be awarded if you use C and Rust for two different projects. Using the same language for all three projects will not qualify for the bonus.</li>
			<li>This bonus applies to the individual not the group.</li>
		</ol>

    <h2>Late Submission Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Late project solutions for projects 1 and 2 will incur a 5-point deduction
      if turned in one day late and 10-point deduction for each additional day
      late. Weekend/holiday/break days are counted when calculating late days.
      Project solutions received after five days from the original due date will
      receive 0 points.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give the grader enough time to finish grading project 3 before semester
      grades are due, late projects will not be accepted for project 3.
    </p>
		<h2>Late Submission Warning</h2>
		<p>Please note that we count the late submission time based on when the LAST commit was made to your GitHub repository. Make sure your group members
		stop commiting code after the deadline to avoid getting a late penalty.</p>
		<p>If you or any of your groupmates commit code beyond the final late submission date (five days from the original due date), you will receive 0 points.</p>
	  <h2>Grade Appeals</h2>
    <p>
      If you are unsatisfied with your grade for a project, make sure to talk to
      the grader within a week of receiving the grade. The actual meeting where
      you voice your complaints can occur after that if needed. If you do not
      say anything within that week, the grade is considered final and will not
      be updated without extenuating circumstances and adequate documentation.
    </p>
    <h2>Florida State Academic Honor Code</h2>
    <p>
      Students are expected to uphold the <a href="https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-and-grievances/academic-honor-policy">academic honor code</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Accommodations for Disabilities</h2>
    <p>
      Students with disabilities needing academic accommodations should
		</p><ol>
			<li>
				Register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource
				Center (SDRC).
			</li>
			<li>
				Bring a letter to the instructor from the SDRC
				indicating your need academic accommodations.
			</li>
		</ol>
			This should be done within
			the first week of class.
			This syllabus and other class materials are
      available in alternative format upon request.
